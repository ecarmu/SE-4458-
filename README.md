Assumptions i made:
  * From the previous project, I had the database initlize with the code. I assumed that could be implemented same since assignment's focus isn't that
  * I assumed user has constant username-password access
  * I assumed all of the needed method shouldn't need autherization
  * I used the codes of the city instead of the names... for example Izmir won't work but IZM will work. I assume this isn't important
